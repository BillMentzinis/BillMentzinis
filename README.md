## Hi there 👋

My name is Bill! I recently obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from the Department of Informatics & Telecommunications at the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens.
I am also pursuing a master's degree in computer science in the same university with a focus on knowledge, data and information management.
I am currently working as a part of a research lab within my university department, where I am conducting research on the broader field of telecommunications.
My main interests at the moment are LLMs and Computer Vision models. I like experimenting with both by building small scale projects.
